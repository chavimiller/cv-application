# cv-application

This project is a CV/Resume-generating application built with React that allows users to input their personal details, education history, and work experience to generate a formatted CV in real time. The app focuses on component reusability, state management with hooks, and controlled form inputs for a smooth editing experience. It provides instant feedback as information is entered or updated, demonstrating core React concepts like props, state, and component structure. The project is not fully responsive and is optimized for desktop use, serving as a foundational exercise for practicing structure, state organization, and interactive form handling in React.
